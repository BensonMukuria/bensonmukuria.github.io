			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<P>This HR analysis report aims to provide an overview of key factors
				related to <b>diversity and inclusion</b>, <b>employee well-being</b>, <b>distribution
					across job levels</b>, and the identification of <b>employees due for promotion </b>
				within the organization. The assessment primarily focuses on <b>gender distribution</b>
				as a measure of <b>diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b>, while considering <b>employee satisfaction</b> in
				terms of <b>marital status</b>, <b>work environment</b>, and <b>work-life balance</b>. By examining
				these
				aspects, the report aims to provide valuable insights into the current state of the organization
				and highlight areas that require attention and improvement. These findings will serve as a foundation
				for developing strategies and implementing initiatives that foster a more inclusive and supportive
				work environment, enhance employee well-being, and ensure fair opportunities for career growth and
				advancement.</P>
			<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
			<p>The organization faces challenges related to diversity and inclusion, employee well-being,
				distribution across job levels, and the identification of employees due for promotion. These
				issues require attention to ensure an <b>inclusive workforce</b>, <b>enhance employee satisfaction</b>,
				address <b>potential disparities in career advancement</b>, and establish a <b>streamlined process for
					recognizing and promoting deserving employees</b>.</p>
			<h2>Data Sourcing</h2>
			<p>The organization provided a comprehensive dataset in CSV format for this HR analysis. The dataset
				includes
				<b>employee demographics</b>, satisfaction ratings on <b>the work environment</b>, <b>marital
					status</b>, and <b>work-life balance</b>,
				as well as information on <b>job levels</b> and <b>promotion eligibility</b>. This dataset serves as the
				foundation for
				deriving insights and recommendations to address diversity and inclusion, enhance employee well-being,
				and
				ensure fair career opportunities within the organization.
			</p>
			<h2>Data Transformation</h2>
			<p>The provided dataset underwent necessary transformations to enhance its usability for the HR analysis.
				One significant transformation involved converting all satisfaction ratings into two categories:
				<b>"satisfied"</b> or <b>"unsatisfied"</b> .
				This was achieved by creating additional columns using Power Query. Similarly. These transformations
				enable a comprehensive analysis of employee satisfaction and well-being, providing more accurate
				insights and targeted recommendations for improvement.

			<h2>Analysis and visualization</h2>
			<p><b>1.Diversity Findings<br></b>
				
					<img  height="150" width="700" src="../images/gender.png" class="image container">
				

				<br>In the organization, out of the total of <b>1470 employees</b>, a gender analysis reveals
				a significant diversity gap. Among the employees, <b>882</b> individuals identify as <b>male</b>,
				while only <b>588 </b>identify as<b>female</b>. This indicates a <b>gender imbalance</b> within the
				workforce,
				with a higher representation of males compared to females. Addressing this diversity gap
				and promoting gender equality will be crucial in fostering a more inclusive and
				representative work environment.
			</p>
			<p><b>2.Employee Well-being Findings</b>
				<br><img height="200" width="700" src="../images/wellbeing.png" class="image container"></br>

				The analysis of employee well-being revealed that <b>60.61%</b> of employees were <b>satisfied</b>
				with their <b>marital status</b>, while <b>39.39%</b> expressed <b>dissatisfaction</b>. In terms of
				<b>environmental satisfaction</b>, <b>61.6%</b> reported being <b>satisfied</b>, while <b>38.4%</b>
				expressed <b>dissatisfaction</b>. Regarding <b>work-life balance</b>, <b>71.16%</b> reported a
				<b>good balance</b>, while <b>28.84%</b> reported a <b>poor balance</b>. These findings highlight
				the need to address marital satisfaction, improve the work environment, and support work-life
				balance for overall enhanced employee well-being.
			</p>
			<p><b>3.Employee Distribution across various job levels Findings<br></b>
			<div style="display: flex; align-items: top; gap: 20px;">
				<img height="350" width="500" src= "../images/distribution.png"alt="Description" >
				
				The analysis of distribution across job levels revealed a breakdown of employee distribution as follows:
					levels 1 and 2, which represent lower levels, accounted for a combined total of 1077 employees. Level 3
					had 218 employees, while levels 4 and 5 had a combined total of 175 employees. This distribution
					indicates
					a relatively fair progression across job levels, with a larger number of employees at the lower levels
					gradually decreasing as the levels advance.
			  </div>
			  <p><b>4.Promotion Eligibility Findings<br></b>
				<div style="display: flex; align-items: top; gap: 20px;">
					
					
				Among the employees analyzed a total of 89 individuals who have been with the 
				organization for
				9 years or more are eligible for promotion. Recognizing these 
				long-serving employees and
				providing them with opportunities for career advancement is crucial to ensure fairness
				 and rewarding
				their
				commitment to the organization. By implementing targeted promotion strategies, the 
				organization can
				facilitate
				the professional growth of these eligible employees and maximize their contributions.
