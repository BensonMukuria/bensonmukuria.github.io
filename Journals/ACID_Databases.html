			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>As a data expert, understanding database principles is crucial, especially those related to <strong>ACID
					(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)</strong>. These properties ensure reliable
				transactions in handling financial systems, e-commerce, or even social media platforms. Let's explore
				these principles through real-world scenarios we encounter daily.</p>

			<h2>1. Atomicity: All or Nothing</h2>
			<h3>✅ Scenario A: Flight Booking Payment</h3>
			<p>You're booking a flight online. The payment process involves:
			    <ol>
				<li>Debiting your account.</li>
				<li>Reserving your seat.</li>
				<li>Sending a confirmation email.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If the email server fails after your account is debited, Atomicity ensures the entire
			transaction
			is rolled back - your money is refunded and the seat is released. No partial bookings!</p>

			<h3>❌ Scenario B: Partial File Upload</h3>
			<p>You upload 100 product images to an e-commerce site, but the connection drops after 70 images. Without
				Atomicity,
				some images save while others fail, leaving your product catalog incomplete.
				<strong>Atomicity guarantees that transactions are fully completed or fully reverted with no in-between
					states.</strong>
			</p>

			<h2>2. Consistency: Follow the Rules</h2>
			<h3>✅ Scenario A: Age-Restricted Purchase</h3>
			<p>An online liquor store requires buyers to be 21+. If a 19-year-old tries to order, the database rejects
				the transaction, maintaining consistency with business rules.</p>

			<h3>❌ Scenario B: Overdraft Without Limits</h3>
			<p>If a bank didn't enforce consistency, you could withdraw more money than you have, leading to negative
				balances
				without penalties.<strong>Consistency ensures databases always follow predefined rules, keeping data
					valid before and after transactions.</strong></p>

			<h2>3. Isolation: No Transaction Interference</h2>
			<h3>✅ Scenario A: Two Sellers, One Product</h3>
			<p>An online marketplace has <strong>only one PS5 left</strong>. Two sellers try to mark it as sold at the
				same time. <strong>Isolation</strong> ensures only <strong>one</strong> succeeds, preventing
				double-selling.</p>

			<h3>❌ Scenario B: Double Booking in a Hotel</h3>
			<p>Without isolation, two travel agents could book the <strong>same hotel room</strong> for different
				guests, leading to an
				embarrassing overbooking situation.<em>Isolation keeps transactions <strong>independent</strong>, so
					concurrent actions don't corrupt data.</em></p>

			<h2>4. Durability: Surviving the Crash</h2>
			<h3>✅ Scenario A: Power Outage During Payment</h3>
			<p>You confirm an order, but the system crashes before showing the receipt. <strong>Durability</strong>
				ensures the transaction
				is <strong>saved permanently</strong>, so your order isn't lost.</p>

			<h3>❌ Scenario B: Lost Game Progress</h3>
			<p>Imagine playing a game where your progress isn't saved after a crash—frustrating, right? Without
				durability,
				databases could lose committed transactions.<strong>Durability guarantees that once a transaction is
					committed, it stays committed—even if the system fails.</strong></p>

			<div class="highlight">
				<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
				<p>ACID principles are the backbone of <strong>reliable databases</strong>. Whether you're handling
					payments, inventory,
					or user data, ensuring <strong>Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability</strong> prevents
					errors, corruption,
					and chaos.Next time you make an online purchase, you should probabbly be thinking about how ACID keeps your transactions safe!
